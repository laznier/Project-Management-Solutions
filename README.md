# My PM Solutions Prototype

This is a simple multi-page site demonstrating project management tools.  
Currently includes:

- **Network Diagram & Critical Path Tool** (in the `network-diagram/` folder).

## Local Development

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the landing page.
3. Navigate to the `network-diagram/index.html` file to try the network diagram tool.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Push all files to a **public GitHub repository**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages** (on the right sidebar in GitHub).
3. Under "Branch," select `main` (or `master`) and then `/ (root)` folder. Click **Save**.
4. Wait a few seconds; GitHub will give you a URL like `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
5. Open that URL in your browser. You should see the landing page.

## Roadmap

- Add more PM tools (Earned Value, Gantt Chart, Risk Matrix).
- Consider a backend (Node.js, etc.) if you want to save user data.
- Improve layout and branding.
